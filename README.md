# Crime Analytics Dashboard – India (2017–2022)
A Power BI dashboard analyzing **state-wise crime data in India** from 2017 to 2022 with demographic insights by **victim age and gender**. This project demonstrates data cleaning, transformation, and interactive visualization skills for real-world datasets.


**Key Features**
- **State-wise crime analysis** across India (2017–2022).  
- **Top 10 States** with highest crime count highlighted.  
- **Demographic insights**: Victim age group and gender distribution.  
- **Geographical insights**: Map visualization of crime hotspots.  
- **Trend analysis**: Yearly crime patterns.  
- **Interactive filters**: Drill down by state, age, gender.
  

**Why This Project Stands Out?**
- Focuses on **real government dataset** (district/state crime reports).
- Combines **demographic breakdowns (age, gender)** with crime analysis.
- Dashboard is **clean, interactive, and ATS-friendly** → suitable for recruiters and MNCs.
- Showcases **end-to-end skills**:  
  - Data Cleaning (Power Query, Excel)  
  - Data Transformation (DAX, Calculated Columns)  
  - Data Visualization (Power BI: maps, treemaps, stacked bars, KPIs)
    
 
**Project Highlights**
- **Top 10 States** with maximum crimes → easy focus on key problem areas.  
- **Age & Gender Demographics** → shows which groups are most affected.  
- **Crime Hotspot Map** → geographical distribution at state level.  
- **Yearly Trends** → how crime patterns evolved from 2017–2022.  
- Professional **dashboard design** with KPIs, treemaps, and drilldowns.
